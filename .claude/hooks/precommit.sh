# scripts all run in CI. Running them here moves the failure from a CI round
# trip to the moment of the commit, where the fix is a single edit.

# The files checked are the ones that differ from HEAD on disk, staged or not,
# plus untracked ones. What is on disk is what a commit records, whether the

# Exit 2 blocks the commit and hands stderr to the model as the reason.
